	/// 	a finite algebra may be not a σ-algebra
	/// 	Finite (or even countable, but for andOrDifClosure we have no countable operator such as sigma) operation of union doesn't guarantee that Omega is in the field though. For example, for the family of all natural number(a set)s, the union would be the set of natural number itself, which is not in the family.
