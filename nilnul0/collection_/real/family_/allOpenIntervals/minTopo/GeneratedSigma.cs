	 What do elements of BR look like?

	Take all possible open intervals.
Take their compliments.
	Take arbitrary unions. Include Ø and R.
	BR
contains a wide range of intervals including open, closed, and half-open
intervals. It also contains disjoint intervals such as (2; 7] U (19; 32). It
contains (nearly) every possible collection of intervals that are imagined.

	The Borel field has got to do with topology: if  A was a topological space, the Borel field B  is the smallest  σ -field containing all open sets.And due to closure under complementation, it will contain all closed sets as well.
